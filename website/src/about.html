  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This website is a supplement to the <span class="todo">[AI Takeoff Report by Tom Davidson]</span>, implemented by <a href="https://epochai.org/">Epoch</a>.</p>

  <p>The best place to start learning about the report is by reading the <span class="todo">[short summary]</span> in Tom Davidson's report. The <span class="todo">[long summary]</span> discusses in more depth the results, while the <span class="todo">[rest of the report]</span> describes in detail the rationale behind the model.</p>

  <p>In the <a href="/description.html">model description section</a>, you will find an interactive explanation of the Full Takeoff Model studied in the report. This will be useful to mathematically inclined readers who wish to understand the model deeply.</p>

  <p>You can interact with the model, and set your own values for its input parameters, in the <a href="playground.html">playground</a>.</p>

  <p>In the <a href="reports.html">reports section</a>, you will find three reports about the results we derive from the Full Takeoff Model:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      In the <a href="reports.html#mc_analysis">Monte Carlo report</a> you will find the distributions of results that come from sampling the parameters according to Tom Davidson's beliefs.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the <a href="reports.html#parameter_importance_analysis">parameter importance report</a> you will find a sensitivity analysis we run, highlighting the most important parameters for pinning down the results of the model
    </li>
    <li>
      In the <a href="reports.html#timelines_analysis">timelines analysis</a> you will find a comparative analysis of the model results conditional on beliefs that correspond to short, medium or long timelines until AGI.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The implementation of the model is available in <a href="https://github.com/epoch-research/ftm">our GitHub repository</a>.
